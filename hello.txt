#This exercise is to rewrite the Hello world program so that 
#(a) the string is assigned to a variable and 
#(b) this variable is then printed with a newline character. 
#Use the double quotes and don't use the concatenation operator. 
#Make sure you can get this to work before proceeding. 

$a = 'Hello world.';	# assign string to variable
print "$a\n";		# Print a message
